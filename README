This code simulates a directional direct dark matter detector and determines
whether a given detector set-up is sensitive to a certain dark matter mass
and dark matter-nucleon cross-section.
After calculating the number of expected neutrino and dark matter scatterings,
the incoming energy and direction of neutrino and dark matter candidate events 
are simulated and a statistical test is performed to decide if the detector can
put an upper limit on the cross-section.
Options to be chosen are detector masses, efficiencies as well as energy and
angular resolution.
