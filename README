This code simulates a directional direct dark matter detector and checks whether a given detector set-up is capable to distinguish for a certain dark matter mass and dark matter-nucleon cross-section a dark matter signal from the neutrino background.

For details on how to use the code, see man.pdf.

This code was used to do the analysis of http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5047.
