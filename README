This code simulates a directional direct dark matter detector and finds whether a given detector set-up is sensitive to a certain dark matter mass and dark matter-nucleon cross-section.

This code consists out of 5 main files:

constants.py:

	initialises constants used for the simulation
	specifies detector set-up
	various options for simulations


simulation_*.py:

	Main file to start the simulation
	There are three files of this type:
		1) incoming neutrino flux set to +1sigma value
		2) incoming neutrino flux set to -1sigma value
		3) sensitivity evolving with exposure
	The file specifies: 
		dark matter mass and cross-section range
		number of pseudo-experiments to be simulated

		
neutrino_functions_*.py:
	
	This file includes all important functions for the neutrino 
	part of the simulation


dm_functions.py:

	All functions related to the dark matter part of the simulation.


create_lookupfiles_*.py:	
	
	This part creates the neutrino energy spectra for a simulation
	and further lookup-files that are used.
